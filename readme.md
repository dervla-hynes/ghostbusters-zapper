# Ghostbusters game

## Rules:
Click the button to zap a random ghost.
Each time the button is pressed, a ghost is hit and its points reduced. Once its points have gone to zero the ghost dies and cannot be hit again. The screen shows the state of all the ghosts after each hit.

The game is over when all ghosts have died or the 'queen' staypuft ghost is killed. You can start a new game once the game is over. 

You start the game with the following ghosts: 

## 1 x 'Queen' = Staypuft monster  
* 80 Hit Points  
* Loses 7 hit points every time it is hit  
* All ghosts die if this is killed 

## 5 x 'Workers" = Slimers 
* Each one starts with 68 hit points  
* Each one Loses 10 hit points each time it is hit 

## 8 x "Drones" = normal ghosts  
* Each starts with 60 hit points  
* Each loses 12 hit points each time it is hit. 

## Project aims:
Build a game using OOP by creating classes for each element(ie. ghost). This allowed me to practice the interaction between different objects and inheritance.
Extention was to create a 'game' object that contanied all the functions to play the game.

This project was built using only vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML.
